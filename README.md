## Inspiration
Many people come to hackathons without a team, 
and must spend valuable time searching for other hackers with similar intrests and skills.
We at Hackr hope to make this a thing of the past.

## What it does
Once you submit your information to us, 
our algorithms will match you with potential teammates at the same hackathon who have similar skills and send you an email to inform you and your match.

## How we built it
Hackr is built using python and flask, and uses Google's Firebase for a database.

## Challenges we ran into
Finding the best match for teammates and handling all the data in the databse.
In addition, MLH has no official API for upcoming hackathons, so we had to scrape their website using Beautiful Soup.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The design and the concept.

## What's next for Hackr
Adding a login system and profiles, and improving the matching algorithm.
